> Medieval simulation/city builder game for the browser.

## About the project

Kingdom architects is intended to be a combined simulation and city building game around building your own kingdom and protecting it from hordes of evil monsters. It is intended to be single-player and playable both on mobile screens and desktop size clients. Your kingdom might last for decades or only seconds, once the browser is closed it's gone and only history might tell its tales.

### Goals for the project
- Play both using the keyboard and mouse/touch.
- Only depend on browser-apis, no extra libraries.
- Kingdoms are ephemeral, you should come back and create multiple kingdoms rather than having a single one for a long time
